# go-channel-checker
Channel Checker for Go

## Features

Allows adding read expectations for a channel.
Uses generics so the channel type can be anything comparable.

## Usage

*Coming soon*.

## TODO
    I plan to add the following:
    - Add ability to expect/match more than one instance.
    - Add ordering.
